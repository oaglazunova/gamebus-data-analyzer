# GameBus Data Analyzer

A tool for extracting and analyzing health behavior data from the GameBus platform.

Officially only Windows is supported. 

## Overview

This project extracts user activity data from the GameBus API and performs various analyses to generate insights about user behavior, activity patterns, and engagement.
The script can technically run on Linux and Mac, but officially we support only Windows.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Python 3.13+**:
- Download Python from the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Run the installer and check “Add Python to PATH”. Then click Install Now.
- Open PowerShell (press Win → type “PowerShell”).
2. **If you have Git**:
 ```
# Replace with the actual repo URL
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd gamebus-data-analyzer
 ```
**If you don't have Git**:
Click the Code button on the repository webpage → Download ZIP.
Unzip it (you’ll get a folder like gamebus-data-analyzer-main).
Open your terminal and cd into that folder, e.g.:
```
cd "C:\Users\<you>\Downloads\gamebus-data-analyzer-main"   # Windows example
```
3. **Set up environment**: 
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. **With the virtual environment activated, run:**:
```
# Windows (PowerShell):
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. **Configure**:
- Create `.env` file with `GAMEBUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- Add user credentials to `config/users.xlsx` (see Configuration section below for format). You can simply use the *.xlsx file with all users generated by GameBus for your campaign: just rename it to users.xlsx and put into `config/` folder, no file modifications are needed.
- For analysis, download GameBus campaign files. Download this file and rename it to `campaign_desc.xlsx`:
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
Download this file and rename it to `campaign_data.xlsx`:
![img.png](img.png)
- Put these files to `config/` folder (`config/campaign_desc.xlsx` and `config/campaign_data.xlsx`)
   
6. **Run**:
```
python pipeline.py                    # Full pipeline (extraction + analysis)
python pipeline.py --extract          # Only extract data
python pipeline.py --analyze          # Only analyze existing data
python pipeline.py --log-level DEBUG  # Verbose logging
```
7. **Where results appear**:
- Raw extracted data → data_raw/
- Analysis outputs (figures, tables, reports) → data_analysis/
- Logs → logs/

## Available Analyses

Running `python -m src.analysis.data_analysis` or `python pipeline.py --analyze` saves all outputs **directly under `data_analysis/`** (no `visualizations/` or `statistics/` subfolders). Descriptive statistics are printed to the console during the run.

**Activities (from `config/campaign_data.xlsx`, sheet `activities`)**
- Activity type distribution → `activity_types_distribution.png`
- Activities over time (daily) → `activities_over_time.png`
- Points by activity type (total) → `points_by_activity_type.png`
- Points by player → `points_by_player.png`
- Average rewarded points by activity type → `rewards_by_activity_type.png`
- Points over time (daily) → `points_over_time.png`
- Player activity counts (top 50 if many) → `player_activity_distribution.png`
- Activity type × player (heatmap) → `activity_type_by_player.png`
- Usage heatmap (weekday × hour) → `activity_heatmap_by_time.png`
- Activity types stacked by date → `activity_types_stacked_by_date.png`
- Player engagement heatmap (by day) → `player_engagement_heatmap.png`
- Activities by day of week → `usage_by_day_of_week.png`

**Campaign metrics & participation**
- Active vs Passive players (by rewarded tasks) → `player_active_vs_passive_pie.png`

**Drop-out & joining**
- Drop-out histogram (first → last activity, days) → `dropout_rates_distribution.png`
- Joining histogram (campaign start → first activity, days) → `joining_rates_distribution.png`
- Combined KDE (drop-out vs joining) → `combined_dropout_joining_rates.png`
- Combined boxplots (drop-out vs joining) → `combined_dropout_joining_boxplots.png`

**Challenges / Tasks (from `config/campaign_desc.xlsx`: sheets `visualizations`, `challenges`, `tasks`)**
- Activity completion by type → `activity_completion.png`
- Activity type by hour → `activity_type_by_hour.png`
- Activity type by weekday → `activity_type_by_day.png`
- Active players per day → `active_players_per_day.png`

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

- `credentials.py`: API endpoints and authentication settings
- `paths.py`: File paths used throughout the project
- `settings.py`: General settings including valid game descriptors and API parameters
- `users.xlsx`: User credentials for GameBus API access (you must create this)
- `campaign_desc.xlsx`: Campaign description data (required for analysis)
- `campaign_data.xlsx`: Campaign activity data (required for analysis)

### API Key

The GameBus API key must be stored in a `.env` file in the root directory:
For the API key, contact GameBus team. 

```
GAMEBUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### User Credentials

`users.xlsx` file in the config directory should have the following format:

```
email               | password      | UserID (optional)
---------------------|--------------|----------------
user@example.com     | password123  | 12345
```

Requirements:
- Must include header row with exact column names: `email` and `password` (lowercase)
- The `UserID` column is optional
- !: You can use the Excel file with users generated for GameBus campaigns. In this case, no modifications are needed.

### Game Descriptors

The `settings.py` file contains a list of valid game descriptors that the system will extract data for. You can modify this list to focus on specific types of activities.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Ensure your API key in `.env` is correct and up-to-date
   - Check that user credentials in `users.xlsx` are valid

2. **Missing Data**:
   - Verify that the game descriptors you need are enabled in `settings.py`
   - Check that campaign files are correctly formatted and in the right location

3. **Analysis Errors**:
   - Ensure both campaign files are present and properly formatted
   - Check that raw data has been extracted before running analysis

### Performance Tips

- Reduce the number of users processed in parallel if experiencing rate limiting
- Comment out unused game descriptors in `settings.py` to speed up extraction
- Use the DEBUG log level to identify specific issues

### Security Note

Configuration files are tracked by Git, but sensitive content (XLSX files with credentials) is ignored through `.gitignore` rules. Always check that your credentials aren't accidentally committed.

## Visualization color palettes and accessibility

- Default theme: Seaborn "colorblind" palette with whitegrid background for readability.
- Categorical charts (bars, lines with distinct series):
  - BAR_COLORMAP = tab20 for many distinct categories.
  - LINE_COLORMAP = tab10 for up to ~10 lines; pandas/seaborn will cycle through the colorblind-friendly palette.
- Sequential data (heatmaps showing magnitude):
  - SEQUENTIAL_HEATMAP_COLORMAP = viridis (perceptually uniform, colorblind-friendly).
- Diverging data (values around a center, e.g., correlations):
  - CORRELATION_HEATMAP_COLORMAP = coolwarm; when plotting correlations, set center=0.
- Single-series bars (e.g., counts over time):
  - SINGLE_SERIES_COLOR = first color from the colorblind palette, used for consistent, accessible single-color bars.

Where to change:
- See src\analysis\data_analysis.py near the top (plot style and colormap constants). Update those constants to customize palettes project-wide.

Example to override in code (optional per script):
- In your analysis script, before plotting:
  - import seaborn as sns
  - sns.set_palette("deep")  # or any seaborn palette name
  - Or change BAR_COLORMAP/SEQUENTIAL_HEATMAP_COLORMAP constants in data_analysis.py.
